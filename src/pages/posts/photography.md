**Photography is the science**, art and practice of creating durable images by recording light or other electromagnetic radiation, either electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as photographic film.  

## My history with phtotgraphy goes many years
Back to the days of [110 film cartridges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/110_film "110 film cartridges"). one of my first cameras was a 110 the film size was smaller than the 35mm (actually 135mm) [film format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/110_film "Film format")  I took it on a school camping trip to [Waterton park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterton_Park "Watertown park") and took pictures of the other kids, forrest and nature. 
I remember with great anticipation giving the film in to be processed and waiting expextantly for the developed negatives and prints to be ready for pickup.

The results were amazing to me! My recolection of the photos were that they were poorly framed, out of focus (the camera was fixed focus) and badly lit. I was in love!

## Stay tuned for my next post, ‘My First SLR’....

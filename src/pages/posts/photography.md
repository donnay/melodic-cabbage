## My history with phtotgraphy goes many years
Back to the days of [110 film cartridges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/110_film). one of my first cameras was a 110 the film size was smaller than the 35mm (actually 135mm) [film format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/110_film) I took it on a school camping trip to [Waterton park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterton_Park) and took pictures of the other kids, forrest and nature. 
I remember with great anticipation giving the film in to be processed and waiting expextantly for the developed negatives and prints to be ready for pickup.

The results were amazing to me! My recolection of the photos were that they were poorly framed, out of focus (the camera was fixed focus) and badly lit. I was in love!

## Coming soon my first SLR

The **Galloping Goose Regional Trail** is a 55-kilometre (34 mi) rail trail between [Victoria, British Columbia, Canada](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria,_British_Columbia), and the ghost town of Leechtown, north of Sooke, where it meets the old Sooke Flowline. The trail forms part of the [Trans-Canada Trail](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Canada_Trail), and intersects the Lochside Regional Trail. It is maintained by the Capital Regional District (CRD).

In late Summer I took a vacation to Vancouver Island and walked along the Galloping Goose.

When going for photo-walks make sure you wear comfortable shoes, don't wear new ones that have not been properly worn in!

I use two cameras:
1. Nikon D300
